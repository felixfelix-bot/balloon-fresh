# Base station BOM — post-ADR-149 (control board)

**Scope:** this record implements [ADR-149](../../../docs/adr/149-base-station-control-board-rescope.md).
The base station stops being an analogue RF instrument and becomes a **control board**; the 433 MHz
receive front end is a purchased SPI module.

**Measured on:** `tracker/hardware/base_station/base_station_v1_placed_v2.kicad_pcb`
**Status:** BOM record only. No board re-fabricated, nothing purchased, nothing powered up.

---

## The change in one line

**44 footprints → 26 fitted parts.** 18 parts are retired from the analogue RF chain; one purchased
433 MHz SPI receiver module is added off-board.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Footprints on board | 44 | **26** |
| 433 MHz BPF | 2 (`FLT_433_A/B` — generic placeholders, never selected) | **0** (module has its own front end) |
| Log detector | 1 (`U_DET`, AD8318) | **0** |
| VGA | 1 (`U_VGA`, ADL5240) | **0** |
| Bias tees | 2 (`TEE1`, `TEE2`) | **0** |
| Load switch | 1 (`Q_LNA_SW`) | **0** |
| Receiver | — | **1 purchased module (off-board)** |

## Retired — 18 parts

Every one of these is verified present on the current board, so the retirement list is measured, not
assumed:

| ref | part | why it goes |
|---|---|---|
| `FLT_433_A`, `FLT_433_B` | 433 MHz BPF — **generic package placeholders**, never a selected device | module front end replaces both; these were the only genuinely self-designed RF parts |
| `U_DET` | AD8318 log detector | 75 dB sensitivity shortfall vs a demodulating receiver; cannot serve as a link receiver |
| `U_VGA` | ADL5240 VGA | existed to drive the AGC loop around the detector; the loop is dropped (ADR-149 D4) |
| `TEE1`, `TEE2` | ZFBT-4R2GW+ bias tees | DC-over-coax masthead feed retired with the detector chain |
| `Q_LNA_SW` | load switch / resettable limiter | protected the masthead LNA branch, which is now an inline module |
| `C_DET1`, `C_DET2` | 100 nF detector output filter | belong to `U_DET` |
| `C_VGA1`, `C_VGA2` | 100 nF / 1 µF VGA decoupling | belong to `U_VGA` |
| `C_LNA1`, `C_LNA2` | bias-tee DC injection bypass | belong to `TEE1`/`TEE2` |
| `C_TAP` | directional/coupled tap (was `TODO(unverified)`) | tap existed only to feed the detector |
| `FB_DET`, `FB_VGA` | ferrite beads for the detector/VGA rails | those rails no longer exist |
| `R_LNA_ILIM` | LNA branch current limit | belongs to `Q_LNA_SW` |
| `J_LNA_FEED` | coax feed to the masthead LNA | masthead LNA concept retired; inline LNA replaces it |

**Verify the count:**

```bash
cd tracker/hardware/base_station
/usr/bin/python3 - <<'PY'
import pcbnew
b = pcbnew.LoadBoard('base_station_v1_placed_v2.kicad_pcb')
rf = {'FLT_433_A','FLT_433_B','Q_LNA_SW','TEE1','TEE2','U_DET','U_VGA',
      'C_DET1','C_DET2','C_VGA1','C_VGA2','FB_DET','FB_VGA','R_LNA_ILIM',
      'C_LNA1','C_LNA2','C_TAP','J_LNA_FEED'}
allrefs = {f.GetReference() for f in b.GetFootprints()}
print('total', len(allrefs), '| retiring', len(rf & allrefs), '| keeping', len(allrefs - rf))
print('retiring not found on board:', sorted(rf - allrefs))
PY
```

Expected: `total 44 | retiring 18 | keeping 26` and an empty "not found" list.

## Kept — 26 parts

| block | refs |
|---|---|
| MCU core | `U_MCU` (RP2040), `U_FLASH`, `Y1`, `C_X1`, `C_X2`, `R_RUN` |
| Power tree | `U_REG` (buck), `L1`, `R_FB1`, `R_FB2`, `R_EN`, `C_IN`, `C_OUT`, `U_LDO`, `C_LDO1`, `C_LDO2` |
| MCU decoupling | `C_MCU1`, `C_MCU2` |
| Protection | `D_REV`, `D_TVS` |
| Connectors | `J_PWR` (9–18 V in), `J_SWD`, `J_433_RX` (SMA, now the module's antenna port), `J_2450_TX` (2.45 GHz TX, separate band, untouched) |
| Test | `TP_5V`, `TP_GND` |

**`J_2450_TX` is deliberately kept.** It is a different band and a different function; ADR-149 is
scoped to the 433 MHz receive front end only.

---

## Added — purchased module (off-board)

| item | part | interface | indicative price | state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 433 MHz receiver | **Adafruit RFM96W breakout** — SX1276, 433 MHz | **SPI**, 3.3 V logic | ~$19.95 | **not purchased** |
| *(optional)* preselector | GPIO Labs 433 MHz BPF, 5 MHz BW, SMA-F | inline SMA | ~$29.10 | not purchased |
| *(optional)* inline LNA | GPIO Labs 433 MHz filtered LNA, 20 dB, SMA-F | inline SMA | ~$54.00 | not purchased |

### Why the receiver needs no detector at all

| device | sensitivity |
|---|---|
| AD8318 (retired) | ~−55 to −65 dBm usable |
| SX1276 (chosen) | **−137 dBm** demodulating (SF12) |

The module returns **packets + RSSI + SNR**, so it provides link telemetry as a by-product of
receiving. The detector's only function was measuring level, which is now derived per packet.

### Optional parts — and the ordering constraint

Both optional parts are inline SMA and sit **before** the module.

**The LNA must come after the filter, not before it.** Its maximum input is around **−10 to −15 dBm**;
a nearby transmitter reaching it unfiltered will saturate it. Filter first, then LNA, then module.

---

## Open item that blocks the final BOM

**The RFM96W breakout is 3.3 V logic only.** The RP2040 is 3.3 V, so SPI is compatible — but the
board's 5 V rail and the module's `VIN` tolerance must be reconciled **explicitly in the schematic**.
Applying 5 V to a 3.3 V-only breakout destroys it. This ADR does not assume it away.

---

## What this does NOT do

- No order is placed and no board is re-fabricated.
- The board file still contains the 26 + 18 parts as-is; re-laying out without the RF chain is a
  separate piece of work.
- `J_433_RX` currently expects an antenna; with a module it becomes the module's antenna feed. That
  re-wiring is schematic work, not yet done.
- Nothing here is qualified. No measurement of a purchased module exists.
