"""v11 corner reservation: find a top-side site for each D_BP diode.

ADR-146 moves D_BP1..4 to the top face. On v10 they are B.Cu-only, so each needs both
connections re-made on F.Cu. This searches the whole top face, not a window around the v10
site, because v11 is a re-layout and D_BP3 had NO viable site near its v10 position (its two
nets occupy opposite halves of the board).

Usage:  /usr/bin/python3 tracker/hardware/v11_diode_sites.py [board]
