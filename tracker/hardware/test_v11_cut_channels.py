"""v11 CUT-CHANNEL GATE: the four nichrome channels, proved from the generated netlist.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS IN THIS SHAPE. The cut channel is irreversible and spends 31 % of the
bank's energy on a spurious fire, so a gate that only asserts "the parts are present" would
be theatre. Every gate below either (a) recomputes a number from the record and compares it
to the netlist, or (b) FEEDS A POISONED DESIGN IN and requires the gate to REJECT it. A gate
that cannot fail is not a gate, so the negative controls are the point, not a formality.

Gates:
  G1  RECORD PARSES AND IS NON-EMPTY      a vacuous pass is a failure
  G2  REGISTRY BLOCK MATCHES THE RECORD   the .reg text is generated, and byte-checked
  G3  TWO-CONDUCTOR LOOP PER CHANNEL      heater drive and dedicated shunt return, and the
                                          loop touches NO solar net (the review defect)
  G4  SHUNT IS IN THE RETURN AND KELVIN   the sense tap is the shunt, not a shared conductor
  G5  SERIALISATION IS ONE-HOT            decoder truth table: exactly one /OE low at any
                                          address, so two FETs can never conduct at once
  G6  LATCH WIRING                        LE high, D shared, Q through R_G, OE from decoder
  G7  SENSE MATH + COUNT RESOLUTION       divider ratio, pin volts, ADS1115 counts at the
                                          PR546 full-scale range
  G8  ABS-MAX BOUND                       pin volts vs VDD+0.3 in BOTH supply states, and the
                                          pin current at VDD = 0 against the 10 mA rating
  G9  NO CHANNEL SHARES A NET WITH ANOTHER each channel's loop nets are disjoint
  G10 ERC DELTA                           kicad-cli sch erc vs the v10/v11 baseline of 9
  G11 NEGATIVE CONTROL: SOLAR-NEGATIVE RETURN MUST BE REJECTED
  G12 NEGATIVE CONTROL: TWO CHANNELS SHARING AN ADDRESS MUST BE REJECTED
  G13 NEGATIVE CONTROL: A MISSING SHUNT MUST BE REJECTED
  G14 NEGATIVE CONTROL: A DIVIDER RATIO THAT BREAKS ABS MAX MUST BE REJECTED
  G15 DETERMINISM                         regenerating yields a byte-identical sheet

#
# The original form was `n_erc == 9`, a hardcoded magic number. Measured on this repo, neither
# board produces 9: v11 gives 10 and v10 gives 26. The difference is ENTIRELY environment-dependent
# -- `lib_symbol_issues` depends on whether the sheet's OWN library directory is reachable, so v10
# scores 16 of them on a host whose project context differs. That is a HOST property, not a design
# property, and a count gate over it compares a design against the machine it runs on.
#
# Worse, a count cannot distinguish a REAL regression from that noise: adding one genuine dangling
# pin and losing one library warning leaves the total unchanged. So G10 compares the KIND SET, and
# counts only the classes that are independent of local library reachability. A new class is a
# regression and is named; a changed lib-symbol count is not.
