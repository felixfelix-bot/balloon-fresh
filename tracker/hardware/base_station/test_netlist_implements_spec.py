"""Verify the generated netlist IMPLEMENTS the spec's frozen invariants.

test_spec_transcription.py checks I copied the freeze correctly. THIS checks the netlist actually
builds what the freeze requires. They are different questions and both must pass.

Invariants checked (each traces to spec.json / the freeze):
  1. all FIVE rails exist, and the four on the +5V side are SEPARATE NETS (the ERC requirement)
  2. NO SAME-NET path from +5V_LNA_SW to +3V3_MCU  (no LNA fault may remove MCU power)
  3. the +5V_VGA rail does NOT share the LNA branch net
  4. the detector input net is reached ONLY through BPF #2 (the mandatory second filter)
  5. the 2.4 GHz TX port reaches NO active device (no 2.4 GHz PA on the PCBA)
  6. the masthead LNA is NOT on this board (no LNA part in the component list)
  7. no circulator part is used
