"""Build the WING INTERCONNECT BOARD (ADR-132 / ADR-134) -- a SMALL series connector.

WHAT THIS BOARD IS (operator's words, 2026-10-25)
-------------------------------------------------
  "the panels won't be mounted to the wing board. The solar cells get mounted to
   styrofoam and the wing board is just a small connector where + and - of each solar
   panel gets soldered onto. The wing board contains the bypass diodes and it makes the
   series connection between the cells and it connects to the hub board."

So the board is a **connector**, NOT a carrier:

  * the CELLS stay on the XPS foam (ADR-117); their bodies never touch this board,
  * each cell's **+ and - tails** solder to one pad pair here (6 pads total),
  * **3 bypass diodes**, one ACROSS EACH CELL -- a short wire jumper from each cell's
    tail to this board puts the diode in parallel with it (ADR-132),
  * **2-pin tab** out to the hub: SOLAR_P and SOLAR_N (ADR-134 removed GND + RF_FEED).

SIZE: 44 x 20 mm = 8.8 cm2, 0.4 mm FR4 = 0.79 g/wing, 3.17 g for four.

WHY IT IS NOT A LONG SPINE (measured, twice)
--------------------------------------------
Two earlier attempts were wrong and the arithmetic caught both:
  * a full cell-COURT board: 83.8 x 159.1 mm = 133 cm2 = 12.0 g/wing, 48 g for four --
    more than the entire ~42 g payload;
  * a 3-cell single-row spine: 197.15 mm long, which does not fit the 167.1 mm arm.
The connector has no such problem because it carries no cell geometry at all.

TOPOLOGY (ADR-046 / ADR-132 sec 2 / ADR-134)
---------------------------------------------
    SOLAR_P -[SC1]- SOLAR_MID1 -[SC2]- SOLAR_MID2 -[SC3]- SOLAR_N
                 |               |               |
                D1              D2              D3     K -> the cell's HIGH node
                 |               |               |      A -> the cell's LOW  node

A reversed diode is forward-biased by its own cell's 0.5 V and silently shunts that cell,
invisible to a string-voltage check (ADR-054 sec 2.3(b)). Hence the printed K marks and a
mandatory first-article reverse-bias test.

LAYOUT RULES THAT COST REWRITES (kept so they are not repeated)
--------------------------------------------------------------
  * pads need >=0.5 mm to Edge.Cuts, or copper_edge_clearance fires at 0.000 mm
  * silk text below 0.8 mm fires text_height on JLCPCB rules
  * a designator sitting on a pad fires silk_over_copper ("clipped by solder mask")
  * derive a dimension from the layout; a hard-coded length left lands off-board
