"""pre-commit: board gates. Blocks a commit that touches PCB connectivity with a failing gate.

WHY THIS EXISTS (operator, 2026-10-22): "Please include it in your git hooks and run it before
showing me the images in future so that you catch and fix such errors before showing me your
progress." Eight custom gates reported all-zero while kicad-cli DRC found 48 violations on the
same board, and the board had no schematic at all. A convention is worth nothing the day someone
forgets; this is the forcing function.

WHEN IT RUNS: only when the staged set touches a board, schematic, footprint, or the
connectivity registry. Other commits pay nothing.

WHAT IT RUNS:
  check_drc.py                kicad-cli pcb drc, classified. clearance/shorting_items are hard.
  check_schematic_parity.py   schematic <-> board parity both ways + ERC (ADR-128)

REFUSAL SEMANTICS: if kicad-cli is missing these gates cannot run. They then REFUSE (non-zero)
rather than pass -- a gate that cannot run must never look green. Set
BOARD_GATES_ALLOW_MISSING_KICAD=1 only to bypass on a machine that genuinely has no KiCad.
