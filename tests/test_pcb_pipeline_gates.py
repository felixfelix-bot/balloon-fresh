"""Structural + behavioural gates for the PCB auto-route pipeline (t_80d91470).

The PCB-V2 Phase 1 card specifies five mandatory quality gates for
``tracker/hardware/full_pipeline.py``.  They were originally expressed as
one-off ``grep`` commands in the card body, which meant a run could report
"gate 3: zone=0" while the shipped file actually contained two ``zone``
occurrences (both in prose).  This suite turns each gate into an assertion
that fails loudly.

Gates (verbatim from the card):

    Gate 1  full_pipeline.py exists and uses NewBoard  (>= 1)
    Gate 2  NO LoadBoard                              ( == 0)
    Gate 3  NO zones                                  ( == 0)
    Gate 4  Uses python3.14                           (shebang)
    Gate 5  (git push -- asserted by the card, not testable here)

Gate 1-4 are static; a fifth set of assertions exercises the pipeline for
real (``--create-only``) since the point of the card is a pipeline that
*cannot silently stop working*.

Why ``NewBoard`` and not ``LoadBoard``: ``pcbnew.LoadBoard`` needs a live
wxApp and fails headless, so the pipeline must build its board from scratch.
Why python3.14: ``python3.11`` segfaults against pcbnew 9.0.8 on this fleet.
