"""test_router_grid_validator_agreement.py -- the router's SEARCH must never permit what its
VALIDATOR (and kicad-cli) forbids.

THE BUG CLASS THIS KILLS (16 instances this session, all the assistant's):

  B34  grid isolation  CLEAR+TRACK_W/2 (0.30) vs validator CLEAR+TRACK_W      -- 0.10 short
  B37  --append did not mark existing TRACKS into the grid
  B44  --append marked tracks but NOT VIAS
  B46  validate_plan read a multi-LEG plan as one path (own_keys[0] vs plan[-1][-1])
  B47  grid via-marking 0.55 vs validator 0.70 (track-vs-via vs via-vs-via)
  B48  the OUTER outline was marked OUTWARD only -- copper INSIDE was unchecked
  B55  routed copper marked at TRACK clearance; a VIA needs CLEAR+VIA_D/2+TRACK_W/2
  B56  --append re-routed a net AGAINST ITS OWN copper

Every one has the same shape: the A* grid (or the append loader) allowed a move that
validate_plan then rejected, or kicad-cli flagged. A router whose search and validator
disagree wastes every search: it finds paths it must throw away.

THE CHECK. For every clearance rule the validator enforces, the GRID's keep-out must be
>= the validator's demand, computed from the same constants. This is arithmetic the file
itself must agree on -- so the test PARSES the router source and asserts the required
expressions are present and dominant at each marking site.

This is a source-agreement test in the same spirit as test_router_gate_agreement.py, but
it covers the marking sites that file does not: the append loader, the routed-copper
re-marking, and the edge band orientation.
